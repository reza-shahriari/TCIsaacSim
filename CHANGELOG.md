## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Golden fixture helper (`tests/golden/conftest.py`, ADR 0004): `.npy` + JSON sidecar with config hash;
  STALE (inputs changed) reported distinctly from FAILING (values changed); actual array dumped to
  `outputs/golden/` on failure; float16/float64 refused on disk; `--update-golden` registered so
  `make golden-update` works. `tests/golden` now runs in `make test`.
- Project scaffold: physics specification (`docs/physics-model.md`), `CLAUDE.md`, skills, build tooling.
- `irsim.radiometry.constants` — physical constants with sources.
- `irsim.radiometry.planck` — spectral radiance (energy and photon forms), fractional exitance,
  thermal derivative. Analytic identity tests passing.
- Layering test enforcing that `src/irsim` imports no engine modules.
- ADR 0002: NumPy ≥ 2.0 floor and Isaac Sim's bundled Python as the project interpreter.
- `docs/roadmap.md`: phased implementation roadmap — 15 milestones, 157 one-commit steps with
  verification tolerances, risk register, ADR backlog, non-negotiable enforcement map, spec issue list.
- ADR 0003: sky targets first, validated against public anti-UAV thermal data (no camera); adds the
  evaluation-harness (ME) and sky/clouds/MTF/point-target (MS) milestones; revised after a four-critic
  adversarial review (72 findings applied); the twelve subsystem maps under `docs/maps/`.

### Changed
- Makefile targets run through a `PYTHON` variable (`make check PYTHON=.../python.sh`); `make test`
  prints the ten slowest tests so the 30 s budget stays visible.
- NumPy floor raised from 1.24 to 2.0 (the Planck tests use `np.trapezoid`).
- ruff ignores `N802` alongside `N803`/`N806` (physics notation such as `d_spectral_radiance_dT`).

### Fixed
- `make check` is green on the scaffold: three files reformatted, one `Any` return in
  `irsim.radiometry.planck` typed explicitly.
